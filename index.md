# Welcome to my Homepage

I am a student at [TU Berlin](www.math.tu-berlin.de). 

I am currently writing my master thesis about the mathematical analysis of peridynamic theory.  
Building upon the work of Prof. Etienne Emmrich and Dimitri Puhst, a main part of my work 
will be the consistent mathematical formulation of the state-based peridynamik theory 
introduced in the paper 
[Silling et al, 2007: Peridynamic states and constitutive modeling](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10659-007-9125-1).
Further I try to give a framework for classical and weak solutions for the resulting nonlocal differential equations.
The letter is based on the methods developped in the Paper 
[Emmrich & Puhst, 2015: Measure-valued and weak solutions to the nonlinear peridynamic model in nonlocal elastodynamics](http://stacks.iop.org/0951-7715/28/285).

A first peak at my work you can see in the slides of my talk in the working group seminar: (states.pdf)
