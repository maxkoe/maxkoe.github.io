# Welcome to my Homepage

I am a PhD student at [TU Berlin](www.math.tu-berlin.de) funded by a stipend of the [Berlin Mathematical School (BMS)](www.math-berlin.de). I am working on the 
subject of stochastic perturbations of second order in time PDEs in collaboration with [Prof. Etienne Emmrich](http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_modnumdiff/diffeqs/v_menue/fg_differentialgleichungen/mitarbeiter/prof_dr_etienne_emmrich/v_menue/home/). 

Up until january I have written my master thesis with Prof. Emmrich. There I treated the mathematical analysis of [peridynamic theory](http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_modnumdiff/diffeqs/v_menue/fg_differentialgleichungen/publikationen/artikel_nach_themen/#c427615) which in turn is centered around a second order in time PDE
related to continuum mechanics. 

Building upon the work of Prof. Emmrich and Dimitri Puhst, a main part of my work 
was a consistent mathematical formulation of the state-based peridynamik theory 
introduced in the paper 
[Silling et al, 2007: Peridynamic states and constitutive modeling](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10659-007-9125-1).
Further I try to give a framework for classical and weak solutions for the resulting nonlocal differential equations.
The letter is based on the methods developped in the Paper 
[Emmrich & Puhst, 2015: Measure-valued and weak solutions to the nonlinear peridynamic model in nonlocal elastodynamics](http://stacks.iop.org/0951-7715/28/285).

A first peak at my work you can see in the slides of my two talk in the working group seminar: 
[About states and ideas for classical solutions to the equation](https://maxkoe.github.com/states.pdf) as well as 
[a primer on the weak theory](https://maxkoe.github.com/states_2.pdf).
